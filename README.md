# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I found it helpful comparing my solutions to someone elses, so I figured other might want to do the same for mine.

## My format

I'm solving using Node.js - The way I'm structuring my file is first my set of functions for each day (e.g. `dayOne()`) then each is followed by the part 2 function (e.g. `dayOneii()`). At the bottom of the file I call the functions, but only whichever function I was most recently solving for.

Between where I'm calling the function and where the daily functions exist, I have a "Utility Functions" section where I'm creating functions that feel like they'd be useful either between days or between parts i and ii for a given day (e.g. my `readFile()` so that I don't have to copy my read file process twice a day).

Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions! ðŸŽ„ Good luck!
